The buttons, from top to bottom, determine how the diagram will be arranged. Try each one to see which arrangement looks best. The input fields may affect the appearance of the diagram. The second and third fields tend to round off the diagram. First, use one of the default options and check the numbers the tool displays. Then you can adjust it near the numbers displayed on the screen.
